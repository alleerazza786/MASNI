The repository hosts MATLAB algorithms designed for generating two tables featuring the evaluated values of diverse graph topological indices for both generalized gear and helm graphs. 
Researchers can use these algorithms to reproduce and extend the analyses conducted in our study, fostering transparency and collaboration in graph theory research.
